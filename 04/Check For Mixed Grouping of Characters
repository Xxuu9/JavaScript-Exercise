Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().

If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can use the following Regular Expression: /P(engu|umpk)in/g

Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string by using the test() method.

let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
The test method here would return true.

Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.

Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false is returned depending on whether the regex matches.let myString = "Eleanor Roosevelt";


let myRegex = /(Franklin|Eleanor).*Roosevelt/; // 修改这一行
let result = myRegex.test(myString); // 修改这一行
// 使用 myString 通过挑战后，了解分组如何运行
